##  **Regression Analysis Projects Summary**

This repository consists three fundamental regression methods employed on real-world datasets. Each project aims at developing, training, visualizing, and comparing regression models for various situations.

---

### 1️⃣ **Simple Linear Regression (SLR)**

**Objective:** Model the dependency between one independent feature and a dependent variable with a linear approach.

**Dataset Used:**
✅ **Salary Dataset** — Has data on **Years of Experience** and associated **Salary**.

**Regression Applied:**
✔️ Simple Linear Regression — Forecasts Salary from Years of Experience.

**Key Highlights:**

* Utilizes `scikit-learn` for model construction.
* Plots data points and fitted regression line.
* Checks model with R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
* Provides readable, understandable results for starters.

### 2️⃣ **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**

**Objective:** Investigate the effect of several independent variables on a target dependent variable.

**Regression Used:**
✔️ Multiple Linear Regression — Makes predictions for index prices 

**Highlights:**

* Utilizes several predictors to ensure improved prediction accuracy.
* Demonstrates the contribution of various features towards the result.
* Employs performance measures such as R² Score and MSE.
* Suits learning real-world, multivariable regression.

### 3️⃣ **Polynomial Regression**

**Goal:** Manage non-linear relationships by converting features into polynomial terms in order to enhance model fit.

**Dataset Utilized:**
✅ **Position Level Salary Dataset** — Includes **Position Levels** and their respective **Salaries**, with a non-linear relationship between them.

**Regression Used:**
✔️ Polynomial Regression (Degree 2/3/4) — Models non-linear trends for precise salary estimation from position level.

**Major Points:**

* Converts features into polynomial terms for complex data patterns.
* Illustrates how polynomial curves better than simple linear models.
* Writes about overfitting dangers and the significance of degree choice.
* Tests model using R² Score and visual comparisons.
